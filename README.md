# weatherAPI

An API to get weather from multiple sources

Assumption:
I set the expiry date for the stale cache is 1 day. I think the weather data will be not use after 1 day.

*Note: If I have more time, I would do:

More Input validation from external API
Better Units conversion process. Right now it is an if statement.....
... And we can always use more tests.
